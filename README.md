# China Bull Shop
RoseHack 2020 project<br>
created by Maddie Louis, Merissa Tan and Kaitlyn Behrens

## Inspiration
Our inspirations for this game were classic arcade games, and the idea of how much fun it would be to be a bull loose in a China shop.

## What it does

This is a single player arcade-style game. The player is the bull, and the aim of the game is to smash as many china as you can, while avoiding being captured by the angry shopkeeper. The game ends when you either get caught by the shopkeeper or escape via the exit. The more china you smash, the higher score you get!

## How we built it

This is a web-app built with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

## Challenges we ran into

Loading graphics/text on HTML canvas is more difficult than it sounds!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The game is fully-functional, fun YET challenging, and aesthetically pleasing!

## What we learned

How to use HTML canvas, making gifs and loading them onto a web-app. 

## What's next for China Shop Bully

Auto-generating levels with increasing difficulty.
